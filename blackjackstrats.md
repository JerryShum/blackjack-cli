### Key Concepts

1. **Hard Hands vs. Soft Hands**:

   -  **Hard Hand**: A hand without an Ace or where the Ace counts as 1 (e.g., 10-6).
   -  **Soft Hand**: A hand with an Ace counted as 11 (e.g., Ace-7).

2. **Dealer's Upcard**: The card that the dealer shows. This is crucial for making decisions.

3. **Player's Total**: The sum of the player's cards.

### Basic Strategy Guidelines

Here are the general rules for making decisions based on your hand and the dealer's upcard:

#### When to Hit or Stand

-  **Hard Totals**:

   -  **8 or less**: Always hit.
   -  **9**: Hit if the dealer shows 2-6; otherwise, hit.
   -  **10**: Double if the dealer shows 2-9; otherwise, hit.
   -  **11**: Double if the dealer shows 2-10; hit against an Ace.
   -  **12**: Stand if the dealer shows 4-6; otherwise, hit.
   -  **13-16**: Stand if the dealer shows 2-6; otherwise, hit.
   -  **17 or more**: Always stand.

-  **Soft Totals**:
   -  **Ace-2 or Ace-3**: Hit if the dealer shows 4-6; otherwise, hit.
   -  **Ace-4 or Ace-5**: Double if the dealer shows 4-6; otherwise, hit.
   -  **Ace-6**: Double if the dealer shows 3-6; otherwise, hit.
   -  **Ace-7**: Stand if the dealer shows 2, 7, or 8; double if the dealer shows 3-6; otherwise, hit.
   -  **Ace-8 or Ace-9**: Always stand.

#### When to Double Down

-  Double down when you have:
   -  **10** against a dealer's 2-9.
   -  **11** against a dealer's 2-10.
   -  **9** against a dealer's 3-6.

#### When to Split Pairs

-  Always split:
   -  **Aces** and **8s**.
-  Never split:
   -  **10s** or **5s**.
-  Split:
   -  **2s** and **3s** against a dealer's 2-7.
   -  **4s** against a dealer's 5-6.
   -  **6s** against a dealer's 2-6.
   -  **7s** against a dealer's 2-7.
